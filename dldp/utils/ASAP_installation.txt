# First, install the dependent packages for ASAP

sudo apt-get install python3-tk
sudo apt-get install libpython3.5-dev
# libpython3.6-dev is also OK.
# sudo apt-get install libpython3.6-dev
pip3 install matplotlib numpy


# Second, download ASAP from the website: https://github.com/computationalpathologygroup/ASAP/releases

# install it by the following command:

sudo dpkg -i ASAP-1.9-python36-Linux.deb


# to find where it was installed, use the command:

dpkg -L asap

#Last, put it in the PYTHONPATH:

PYTHONPATH="/opt/ASAP/bin":"${PYTHONPATH}"
 export PYTHONPATH

# PYTHONPATH can be empty if your restart the computer.
# A way to fix it is to add the two lines right after "PATH" to the file of "your-python-enironment-folder/bin/activate"
PYTHONPATH=/opt/ASAP/bin":$PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH


# Now we can test it:

>>>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>>import multiresolutionimageinterface as mir
>>>reader = mir.MultiResolutionImageReader()
>>>mr_image = reader.open('/your-CAMELYON16-training-tumor-folder/tumor_036.tif')
>>>dims = mr_image.getLevelDimensions(6)  #number 6 here is the level of image. 
>>>tile = mr_image.getUCharPatch(0, 0, dims[0], dims[1], 6)
>>>plt.imshow(tile)
>>>plt.show()
>>>tile =mr_image.getUCharPatch(37000, 90000, 1024, 1024, 0)
>>>plt.imshow(tile)
>>>plt.show()
